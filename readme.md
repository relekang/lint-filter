# lint-filter

Only show style errors of things that have changed since master. This support tools that support exporting output in checkstyle format. This can be useful if you want to convert a project gradually towards a new config, (e.g. adding a new rule from the latest release of your linter). Another case were this is beneficial is were you do not want to break a build when updating the linter.

If you are comfortable with it bug reports in form of a pull-request with a broken test would be awesome. *Unsure about where the test belong?* Then create a new file in the test folder with your test. *Unsure about how to do create a pr?* You can check out [How to create a Pull Request on GitHub][pr-tutorial-link], a video tutorial by @kentcdodds or drop by the [gitter channel][gitter-link] and ask for help.
